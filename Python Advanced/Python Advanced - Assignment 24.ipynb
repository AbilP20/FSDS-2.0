    "Circular importing can lead to import errors because the program won't know which module to be loaded first. It may also lead to infinite loops if not handled. The best way to tackle this issue is to utilse the use of `__name__` - it is an in-built python attribute that is associated with every python module. `__name__` tells python whether a module is being run as the main program or it is being imported in another program. If the module being run is the main program then the code is - `__name__ ==  \"__main__\"`. And if it is being imported in another program then instead of main, you write that module name - `__name__ ==  \"module_name\"`"

We can also manually set this `__all__` to define what all functions will be included - it may or may not be public, if the public function is not defined by the person in the `__all__` variable, then it won't be imported.
