    "Object Oriented Programming uses classes and objects that represent a real world entity. The traditional programming approach used functions which could not be identified as real-world objects. OOP brings with it, various advantages like modular programming, reusabilty of code, extending function usage using polymorphism and much more. Python has a very user-friendly environment which helps to implement the concept of OOP easily."
