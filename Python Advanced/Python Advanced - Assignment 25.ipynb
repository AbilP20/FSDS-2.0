    "Numpy array is a homogenous datatype object i.e they store single type of object like integer objects or string objects etc.. They are used for efficient and fast mathematical calculations on arrays or multi-dimensional matrices. Pandas dataframe, on the other hand may and may not be homogenous. It is rows-columns combination with multiple datatype objects. Pandas dataframe is generally used for analyzing data. We can convert numpy arrays to dataframes and vice versa. "
