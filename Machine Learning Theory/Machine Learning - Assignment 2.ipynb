    "1. Classical Conditioning - humans learn to associate events or stimuli that repeatedly happen together. Eg. humans know that if our body feels hot and shivers, it means they have cold - in most cases cold is associated with shivering and high temperature. This can be similar to a supervised ML technique where a given set of features and target is trained and then machine can identify similar patterns and group them accordingly. \n",
    "2. Operant Conditioning - a response is associated with a consequence. Eg. a dog is trained by giving a treat when it listens to the human. This type of human learning is the ML eqiuvalent of Reinforcement Learning where an agent learns by getting a reward for each correct action and is penalized for wrong actions."

A good model will classify the letter A of both persons the same every time with comparable accuracy.

    "In stats, regression refers to the measure of relation between 2 or more independant variables and a dependant variable. It is the same in ML. It is a supervised technique where a continuous value is predicted by creating a best fit line that passes through most of the data points. Error is added knnowingly to increase generalization. For eg. we want predict the no. of marks (target) obtained in an exam by knowing the no. of hours (feature) studied. The general trend in a real-world is more the no. of hours, more is the marks. So is the case here. The best fit line has a positive slope and a positive correlation. There may be outliers also, exceptions like someone studies more but scored less. The best fit line introduces some bias in such cases so that it can fit this data and then make the prediciton better. "

    "##### ii. Studying under supervision\n",
    "Studying under supervision refers to the supervised learning method. In this method, data is labelled, i.e we have some features and we also have the target. For eg. we as humans know about cars, so if we see an object that has 4 wheels - windows - outside mirrors - is painted in some color - has lights in the front - has wipers on the front windshield - has brake lights - has exhaust, all these are features of that object - then we will identify that object as a car. This is studying under supervision. The opposite case is studying without supervision. In this we will only have data. For eg. many humans do not know about all breeds of dogs. So if an unknown breed of dog is shown, most humans will generalize it as a dog. This is without supervision. But with supervision, the humans would have knowledge about the exact species of that dog. For eg. a zoologist or a dog-lover. "

    "In reinforcement learning, the learning is purely and completely based on reinforcement, that is the consequence of the action. The agent learns from each reward (postive outcome) it receives for each good step. If the agent receives a reward, it learns to take such action in similar state whereas when the agent receives a penalty(punishment) for a bad step, it does not learn this state-action pair. Therefore, RL is a form of learning based on positive reinforcement."
