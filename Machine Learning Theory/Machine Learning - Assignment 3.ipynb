    "Machine learning is the capablity of machines by which they learn patterns, relations between data and use it to predict unseen data. It is a subset of AI which provides algo to learn these patterns and relations. It works by learning features and target of huge data. It is initialized with a weight and bias and then in each iteration, it adjusts the weight and bias to better fit the data, therby reducing the loss.\n",

    "Applications in Business:\n",
    "1. fraud detection - By learning about normal behaviour in financial transactions, the ML model can detect when an abnormal behaviour i.e. a fraud activity is taking place.\n",
    "2. sentiment analysis - analyze comments, tags or statements given by users on a specific product. This analysis can be used to guide the business as to which product users are into more or which product cater to which age group etc.\n",

    "Ethical Concerns:\n",
    "1. privacy issues - ML is data hungry. The data that is provided must not have confidential info. And if it is required, then also measures must be taken by the entity that data leakage does not happen to some 3rd party.\n",
    "2. unfair - if data about certain category is less, then predictions about that category will be less accurate, meaning business decisions cannot be taken for that category with good precision.\n",
    "3. lack of transparency - many ML algo are unable to explain the course of their training and how they predict something. this lack of transparency can raise concerns in fields like business or healthcare. "

ML is a small subset of the huge set Data Science. In order to solve complex problems, we have to use advanced concepts and techniques. For eg. today the application of computer vision is growing more and more. We can't just use a traditional ML model to use Computer Vision because on images and videos, the ML models could take a lot of time and resource. That is why we have another set Deep Learning which involves the CNN architecture for using on image and videos. Similarly various tasks need various techniques. ML has provided the base for solving many such problems."

    "1. Tensorflow:\n",
    "   \n",
    "TensorFlow is an open-source software library for building neural networks. Google Brain team was the one who built it and it is the most popular deep learning library in the market today. Tensorflow is made of tensor-meaning multi-dimensional array and flow-representing continuous flow of data. TensorFlow can train and run the deep neural networks for image recognition, handwritten digit classification, recurrent neural network, word embedding, natural language processing, video detection, and many more. TensorFlow is run on multiple CPUs or GPUs and also mobile operating systems. TensorFlow makes use of a graph framework. TensorFlow library integrates different high level API (Keras for eg.) to create and scale deep learning architecture like CNN or RNN . TensorFlow is based on graph computation. The chart gathers and describes all the computations done during the training. It can allow the developer to create the construction of the neural network with Tensorboard. This tool helps debug our program. It runs on CPU (Central Processing Unit) and GPU (Graphical Processing Unit). Using tensorflow is easy as it provides all necessary modules required to easily create decision tree models, svm, CNN, etc.\n",

    "2. Pytorch:\n",
    "\n",
    "PyTorch is an open-source machine learning library developed by Facebook's AI Research lab (FAIR). It is widely used for building and training deep learning models. In many ways, pytorch is similar to tensorflow as pytorch also works on tensors. The major difference between both is that pytorch makes use of dynamic computational graph. Unlike tensorflow's graph, PyTorch builds a new computational graph on-the-fly during each forward pass and it automatically calculates gradients during the backward pass. This dynamic approach is beneficial for tasks involving varying input sizes or dynamic structures. It also makes the graph more intuitive and easier for debugging. PyTorch provides a rich set of neural network building blocks in the torch.nn module. These include layers, activation functions, loss functions, and optimization algorithms. \r\n",
    "Users can easily define and customize neural network architectures using PyTorch's modular design. Each component can be subclassed and modified, providing flexibility and ease of experimentation."

    "Supervised learning is largely divided in the below 2 forms:\n",
    "1. Regression - it is used in predicting a continuous numerical value based on the given input features. One simple example is predicting house prices. The features required to predict a house price could be location, size, no. of rooms, ammenities nearby etc. What a regression algo will do is try to find correlation b/w these features and the target feature, i.e. house price. The regression algo creates a best fit line which helps in predicting price based on new input features.\n",
    "2. Classification - It is used in predicting a discrete categorical or a numerical value based on the given input features. Eg. we want to classify mail as spam or not spam. Unlike regression where best fit line finds correlation, the classification algo creates a best fit line in a way that divides the 2 classes - spam and no spam. All or most of the spam data will lie in one half and the no-spam in the other half. When a new data arrives, the region it lies in will decide which class it belongs to"
